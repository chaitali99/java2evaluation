Que:Diference between HAS-A and IS-A realtionship with the help of example?and explain aceess modifier and their accessibility.
Ans:
Access Modifier:
	1.private:The access of a private modifier is only within a class it can not be accessed from outside the class.
	2.Default:The access of a default modifier is only within a package.It cannot be accessed from outside the package.
	If you do not specify any access modifier it will act as a default.
	3.Protected:the access of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child If you
	do not make child class it cannot be access from outside the package.
	4.Public the access of public modifier is everywhere it can be accessed from the class within the package and outside 
	the package.
	
	IS-A:An IS-A relationship is inheritance.The classes which inherite are known as sub classes. 
	On the other hand,HAS-A relationship is composition.
	
	In OOP IS-A relationship is completely inheritance. This means, that the child class is a type
	of parents class. For example, an apple is a fruit. So you will extend fruit to get apple.
	
	class Apple extends Fruit{
	}
	
	on the other hand, composition means creating instances which have references to other objects for example a 
	room has a table so you will create a class room and then in that lass create an instance of type table.
	
	class Room{
	
		Table t=new Table();
	} 
	
	A has-a relationship is dynamic binding(runtime) while inheritance is a static (compile time)binding if you just want to reuse
	the code and you know that the two are not of same kind use composition. For example, you cannot inherit an oven from a 
	kitchen A kitchen Has-a oven when you feel there is a natural realtionship like apple and fruit use in inheritance.
